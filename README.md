# discord-webhook

This is a web application that acts as a frontend to send messages through the Discord Webhook API.

## Why?

There are two main points as to why I started this project:

- I am a member of the [Českolipská Esports](https://ceskolipskaesports.cz) organization. We need to send messages under one, shared username. We could obviously just share a Discord account, but 1., that is against the ToS, as far as I'm aware, and 2., it is very insecure. If one of our computers/browsers were to get compromised, then the bad actor would be able to send messages on our behalf, and we would probably take a good amount of time to respond - 10 minutes, at least. 10 minutes is a lot of time, way more time than we can afford.

- I am trying out the Bun runtime. I want to learn how it compares to the rest of the ecosystem (e.g. pnpm), because I like to learn new things.

## Upcoming features
